In GraphQL, there are two different kinds of types.

1. Scalar types represent concrete units of data. The GraphQL spec has five 
predefined scalars: as String, Int, Float, Boolean, and ID.

2. Object types have fields that express the properties of that type and are 
composable. Examples of object types are a User or Post, and all the resources 
your project may have.

In every GraphQL schema, you can define your own scalar and object types. An 
often cited example for a custom scalar would be a Date type where the 
implementation needs to define how that type is validated, serialized, and 
deserialized.
