# Write a recursive method to solve `make better change`.

# HINT: To make_better_change, we only take one coin at a time and
# never rule out denominations that we've already used.
# This allows each coin to be available each time we get a new remainder.
# By iterating over the denominations and continuing to search
# for the best change, we assure that we test for 'non-greedy' uses
# of each denomination.

# make_better_change(24, [10,7,1]) should return [10,7,7]

def make_better_change(value, coins)
  return nil if coins.empty?
  return [] if value == 0

  change = []
  coins = coins.sort.reverse.select{|coin| coin <= value}
  coins.my_each do |coin|
    remainder = value - coin
    if remainder > 0
      best_remainder = make_better_change(remainder, coins)
      change << [coin] + best_remainder unless best_remainder.nil?
    else
      change << [coin]
    end
