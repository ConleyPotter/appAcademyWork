### DISPLAY ###

- Specifies the type of rendering box used for an element
- The bread and butter values of display are:
  - none
  - block
  - inline
  - inline-block
- There are several more exotic types such as table and flex

## Display None ##

Turns off the display for the element. The page is rendered as though the element 
did not exist.

## Display Blcok ##

- The default property for display
- Cannot contain block elements
- Inline follows text flow
- Think of inline elements as words that flow in a paragraph, they follow each 
  other, are placed on a baseline, and wrap if they do not fit in the parent 
  container
- Elements take up minimal width and height to accommodate content
- You cannot manually set height and width
- Padding and margin only work sensibly left and right, pushing other inline 
  elements horizontally away
- Vertical padding and margin overflows and is often undesired
