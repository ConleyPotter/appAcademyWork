### General Rules ###

- The more specific selector wins
- If equally specific, the last declared one wins
- Styles cascade, if not overwritten
- Avoid !important, inline styles and id selectors. They do not lead to dry, 
  maintainable code.
- You can apply your styles to multiple selectors at once by separating them by 
  commas: selector1, selector1 { property: value; }
