// CLASSES // 

// ES2015 provides an alternative syntax for creating object-constructor 
// functions. ES2015 lets us create classes with a more intuitive and Ruby-like 
// syntax. Consider this example:

class Bicycle {
  constructor(model, color) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
  }

  action() {
    return "rolls along";
  }

  ride() {
    console.log(
      `The ${this.color} ${this.model}  
      goes "whoosh" and ${this.action()}!`
    );
  }

  static parade() {
    Bicycle.funBicycles.forEach(bike => bike.ride());
  }
}

const cruiser = new Bicycle("Schwinn", "turquoise");
const salsaFargo = new Bicycle("Salsa Fargo", "burnt orange");
const flyingMerkel = new Bicycle("Flying Merkel", "green");
const bianchiVolpe = new Bicycle("Bianchi Volpe", "slate blue");

Bicycle.funBicycles = [cruiser, salsaFargo, flyingMerkel, bianchiVolpe];

Bicycle.parade();

// The turquoise Schwinn goes "whoosh" and rolls along!
// The burnt orange Salsa Fargo goes "whoosh" and rolls along!
// The green Flying Merkel goes "whoosh" and rolls along!
// The slate blue Bianci Volpe goes "whoosh" and rolls along!

// prototype methods (instance methods) are written right within the class 
// object, as is the special constructor function that initializes a new object.

// static methods can also be defined within the class object; they mimic class 
// methods by being called without instantiating the class.

// :bike::bike::bike:

// Classes are just sugar

// Although ES6 classes may look pretty different from ES5, they are ultimately 
// just syntactic sugar for the same prototype-based inheritance model we already 
// know.
