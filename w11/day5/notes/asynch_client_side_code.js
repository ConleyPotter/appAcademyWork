// setInterval: a case study //

// When your JavaScript code is being run in the browser, it blocks the browser 
// from doing other things. This includes running other JS code, making new 
// browser requests, rendering HTML, and even scrolling. For instance, try this:

{/* <html>
  <body>
    <script>
      while (true) {
        console.log("Help! I'm stuck in a loop!");
      }
    </script>

    <h1>This heading never appears!</h1>
  </body>
</html> */}

// Your tab should be entirely locked up; you'll have to close it. Notice the 
// h1 tag is never rendered; the browser stopped rendering the HTML to run the 
// script, but the script never finished!

// However, JS engines give you a way around this. Replace the contents of the 
// above script with the function below:

window.setInterval(function() {
  // call this once per second
  console.log("Whee! I'm in a loop but still working!");
}, 1000);

console.log("Timer set!");

// The window.setInterval method schedules a timer that fires once every 1000 
// milliseconds. When the timer fires, our function is called. This approximates 
// a loop, but it is non-blocking, i.e., it doesn't stop other browser processes 
// from running.

// Because setInterval simply sets a timer that runs in the background, it 
// completes almost instantly. As a result, console.log("Timer set!") is called 
// immediately after setInterval runs and the rest of the document continues to 
// load. Then, every 1000 milliseconds, the callback is invoked by the JS engine.

// If you wonder how you could possibly write window.setInterval in pure JS, 
// the answer is that you can't. The browser needs to provide that functionality. 
// This is an example of a browser API that allows us to do things that pure 
// JavaScript can't. We can ask the browser to set a timer through the 
// JavaScript API, but we couldn't write it ourself in JavaScript.

// For even better animation performance, try using requestAnimationFrame 
// instead of setInterval. This function takes a single callback as an argument 
// and executes that function when the browser is ready. Inside that callback 
// you should then make an additional call to requestAnimationFrame.

function animate() {
  game.advanceState();
  game.clearScreen();
  game.drawEverything();
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

// Even though it might look like animate will get triggered instantly, it 
// won 't. Instead, the browser intelligently calls animate around 60 times 
// per second, perfect for animations. You can read more about 
// requestAnimationFrame here. {https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame}

// CALLBACKS AND EVENT HANDLERS //

// An idiom from our Ruby game code is to enter a loop, request user input, and 
// then pass the input to the game. The closest thing in Javascript is the 
// synchronous prompt command:

// wait for input
constant userInput = window.prompt();

game.makeMove(userInput);

// Don't use prompt. This pops up an input box for the user to type in text. But 
// because the prompt waits for user input, it blocks the entire page. Nothing 
// at all can happen (they can't even scroll). This is bad.

// Let's consider an alternative approach that runs asynchronously. We will 
// register (or bind) a function (called a handler) to be called by the browser 
// when an event occurs. Here's an example:

{/* <html>
  <head>
    <title>A page for you!</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <input type="text" id="text-field" value="">
    <button id="submit-button">Submit me!</button>

    <script type="application/javascript">
      const textField = document.getElementById('text-field');
      const button = document.getElementById('submit-button');

      const showValue = () => {
        let inputValue = textField.value;
        alert(inputValue);
      }

      button.onclick = showValue;
    </script>
  </body>
</html> */}

// JavaScript lets us ask the browser to notify us of events. Here, we're asking 
// the browser to listen for the onclick event of button. When a user presses 
// the mouse while it is hovered over the button, the browser interprets this as 
// an onclick of the button. It then calls any JavaScript code that has been 
// registered as a handler for the event, i.e. showValue.

// Our handler extracts the value of the textField and gives it to alert.

// Paste this example into an.html file, open it in your browser and try it out!
