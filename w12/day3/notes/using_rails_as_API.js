// So far, we've used Rails to handle all the different parts of our
// web application stack:

// - Database management (ActiveRecord )
// - Request routing(router and controllers)
// - User interface rendering (views).

// While Rails certainly excels at all these things, we're now moving into the
// next iteration of our web-application stack: client-side rendering. Going
// forward, we'll be applying more and more Javascript when rendering our pages
// to create dynamic content. This means that we'll be relying on Rails
// HTML views less and less. Eventually, our Rails endpoints (controller
// actions) will stop serving HTML and only serve database information
// (as json) to be used by our client-side rendering scripts. When a web server
// provides non-UI formatted information like this, we call it a web API.

// WHAT IS AN API? //

// A **server-side web API** is a programmatic interface consisting of one or
// more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request-response message
// system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the
// web â€”- most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server.

// The Rails projects we've done so far haven't been APIs, because they've
// tightly coupled database information to a pre-defined set of fixed
// UI-templates (our views). To make Rails an API, we're going to rewrite
// those views so that they serve up raw JSON information instead of HTML;
// we'll call these views endpoints.

// This setup will let us write client-side Javascript that utilizes our
// endpoints to render our UI dynamically by requesting, posting, and
// displaying server information as it executes.

// EXAMPLE //

// Static HTML Implementation(The Old Way)

// Take a look at this CatsController:

# app/controllers/cats_controller.rb

```RUBY
class CatsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @cats = Cat.all
    render :index
  end
end
RUBY ```

// It should render the following template whenever we visit localhost:3000/cats:

``` ERB
<!-- app/views/cats/index.html.erb -->
<h1> Cats </h1>

<ul>
<% @cats.each do |cat| %>
  <li><%= cat.name %>: <%= cat.color %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
```

// Let's go ahead and change this around to be an API. We want 
// localhost:3000/cats to no longer give us a static HTML page, but rather 
// a text-based representation of said cats that our client-side Javascript 
// can use to render a dynamic view.

// API Implementation (The New Way)

// Our application needs to be able to respond to client-side requests for 
// JSON. Lucky for us, Rails is smart enough to route HTTP requests for 
// different data types to the corresponding views for that type. If a request 
// with a header for Accept: application/json comes in, CatsController#index 
// will automatically try to render app/views/cats/index.json.jbuilder instead 
// of the app/views/cats/index.html.erb view we wrote earlier. All we have to 
// do is write that view:

// # app / views / cats / index.json.jbuilder

// json.array! @cats

// The code above renders a json array of cat objects by simply passing @cats 
// to the Jbuilder's json.array! method.

// Don't worry if you've never heard of Jbuilder. It's just a gem that lets us 
// write Ruby code to create JSON objects, much like how ERB is used to create 
// HTML. We'll be learning more about it soon!

// If you're interested in how Rails resolves the response type, 
// check out this blog post.

// USING THE API //

// If we now use our client-side rendering scripts to make an AJAX GET 
// request, AJAX will try to make an intelligent guess and set the Accept 
// header in our request to xml, json, script, text or html.

// The Accept header advises which content types, expressed as MIME types, 
// the client is able to understand.

// Let's take a look at the following request:

$.get({
  url: '/cats'
});

// The generated request will set the Accept: '*/*', and effectively advises our 
// Rails server that any type of response will be OK. In this particular case, 
// Rails will decide which response to return based on our controller's 
// respond_to ordered values (see below for an example).

// If we try (and we say try because the server will try to accommodate our 
// request) to get a JSON response rather than an HTML one, we need to 
// specifically set the dataType.

$.get({
  url: '/cats',
  dataType: 'json'
})

// The above will set our Accept header...

// application / json, text / javascript, */*; q=0.01

// ...to successfully letting the server know that we prefer JSON responses.

[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Amitabh", "color": "Gray"},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Fabio", "color": "Calico"}
]

// Our client-side JS can then parse and use the information easily to present 
// our information dynamically (i.e. according to our instructions).

// NB: We can still get our old HTML view by making an Accept: text/html request 
// to localhost:3000/cats, but at this point, who'd want to?

// respond_to //

// Fortunately, controllers are versatile. A single controller can handle both 
// JSON and HTML requests. By looking at the requested Accept header or the 
// format of the URI (i.e., going to /cats.html vs /cats.json), the 
// controller can determine which format our response should be populated 
// in and then act accordingly.

``` ruby
# app/controllers/cats_controller.rb

class CatsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @cats = Cat.all
    
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { render :index }
      format.json { render :index }
    end
  end
end
ruby ```

// Any request for HTML will hit the index.html.erb view and any request for 
// JSON will hit the index.json.jbuilder view. The controller knows where to go 
// based on the format.Any request for HTML will hit the index.html.erb view 
// and any request for JSON will hit the index.json.jbuilder view. The
