// HISTORY //

// History is a web api that allows us to manipulate the browser's session
// history. We can think of the session history as the stack of URLs that a
// user has visited within a given tab. In client-side javascript, we can
// access the History object by calling window.history.

// The history interface provides us with a number of methods for manipulating
// the session history. A few useful methods are window.history.back() and
// window.history.forward().These methods pop and push items onto the session
// history stack respectively (the equivalent of pushing the back an forward
// buttons in your browser). Test them out in a browser window!

// For more methods, see the MDN History Documentation.

// LOCATION //

// Location is another web api that allows us to access and manipulate the
// current URL. In client-side javascript, we can access the Location object
// via window.location.

// A few useful properties of the Location object (test these out in a browser
// window to see what they return):


// - window.location.href: this returns a string containing the entire URL. Try
//   setting this to the url of another site. It should make another GET request
//   and navigate the URL.

// - window.location.hash: this returns a string containing a "#" followed by
//   the "fragment identifier" (the portion of the url following the #). Try
//   setting window.location.hash to any string. This should append a fragment
//   identifier to the URL in the search bar but will not make another GET request.

// Note: With both changes, altering the locations will push to the History
// object.

// For more methods, check out the MDN Location Documentation.

//  The haschange event //

// When we alter window.location.hash, we fire a special hashchange event.
// We can add a handler for this event and trigger a callback function
// whenever the hash changes.

// Try out the following in your browser's console:

window.addEventListener('hashchange', function() {
  console.log(`The hash is now: ${window.location.hash}`);
});

window.location.hash = 'new-hash';

// The hashchange callback should be triggered! We aren't doing anything useful
// on hashchange just yet, but soon we'll use it to render different content
// to our page based on the hash fragment. Cool!
