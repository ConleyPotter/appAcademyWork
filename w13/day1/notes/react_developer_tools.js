// DEBUGGING REACT IS HARD //

// React is a great front-end framework, but can be tough to debug or see the
// big picture. Nested components defined in other disparate folders and JSX
// syntax make it hard to get a clear snapshot of your component hierarchy and
// each component's internal state.

// REACT DEVELOPER TOOLS ARE WICKED EASY //

// React Developer Tools are easy to install and require no set-up. Just
// install the React Developer Tools Chrome Extension and open up the Chrome
// Console. You should see a new tab, 'React', that will show you all your
// components, and give you access to their state.

// Check out the docs for a brief overview. You can even use React Developer
// Tools on the React homepage. So meta. A couple things to try:

// - Inspect a component, looking at it's props and state
// - Change a component's state from the console
// - Compare a component to the native HTML it generates (look at the
//   "Elements" tab)

// Take a few minutes to install the extension and play around with it while
// completing tonights homework. If nothing else, it will expand your visual
// model of React and your component hierarchy.
