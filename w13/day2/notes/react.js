// WHAT IS REACT? //

// React is a JavaScript library for creating UI components. React's specialty
// is exactly what its name implies: reaction. When the data that is
// represented by the UI changes, React reacts by updating the UI.

// WHAT ISN'T REACT? //

// React isn't a front end MVC framework. There are no models, no collections,
// no controllers, and no templates. The basic library provides no router.

// WHY WOULD WE NEED REACT? //

// As your application grows in size and complexity, managing the maze of
// callbacks and event handlers responsible for updating your views will
// quickly become unwieldy. React's mission is to manage all UI updates when
// any piece of your app changes. Using it, we will no longer need to manually
// update elements on a page in response to user input! When the state of the
// application changes, React re-renders all elements. Thanks to the use of a
// 'virtual DOM', this process is just as fast as isolating the changing element.

// It gets better: the other primary focus of React is to provide a simple
// interface for front - end developers to use.You describe how you want
// your UI to look at any given point in time and React takes care of the rest.

// HOW DOES IT WORK? //

// In traditional JavaScript applications, you must look at which pieces
// of data changed and surgically update the DOM to reflect the new state.
// Using React, when the component is initially rendered, the markup is
// generated and added to the document. When the data is changed, React
// renders again, but instead of replacing the component wholesale, it updates
// only the bit that has changed. It effectively runs a 'diff' on what is there
// compared to what should be there. This way the absolute minimum change can
// be applied to the DOM. This process is called reconciliation.

// This process of reconciliation is so fast that we don't need to carefully
// check which parts are rendering. We can re-render an entire page
// in milliseconds.
