// Although we can rely on Rails content-type routing to delineate what
// type of HTTP responses our web app generates, a better pattern is to nest
// our API endpoints under a namespace.

// A namespace is just a subset of controllers that live under a specific URL.

// We'll start off by creating a new controller: rails g controller
// api/cats, which is created in the app/controllers/api/cats_controller.rb
// file. Then we need to tell our router about our new controller:

```RUBY
# config/routes.rb

namespace :api do
	resources :cats, only: [:index]
end
```;

// Running rails routes, we get:

//   Prefix Verb URI Pattern         Controller#Action
// api_cats GET  /api/cats(.:format) api/cats#index

// Finally, we have to store our index.json.jbuilder view in the location
// app/views/api/cats/index.json.jbuilder so our new Api:CatsController
// can find it. Now we can access our api endpoint on localhost:3000/api/cats.
