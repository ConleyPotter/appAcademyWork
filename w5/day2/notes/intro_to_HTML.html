Front-end Development

Front-end development can be split up into three major coding langauges: 

HTML - HyperText Markup langauge defines the structure of a website semantically
and the content tha tiwll be rendered by the web broswer. 

CSS - Cascading Stylesheets deal with the presentaiton of content including 
aspects such as layout, formatting and colors.

Javascript -One of the most popular coding langauges in the world, brings
movement and user interation to websites

This curriculur focuses on teh first two cornerstones of modern front-end
development. 

HTML 

HTML is made up of elements denoted using opening and closing tags: 

<p>THis is an exmaple of a paragram element in HTML</p>

These elements form the building blocks of an HTML document and may either 
directly introduce content or wrap content to provide information about 
document text.

For example, the above <p></p> tags wrap the containing document text i
nto an HTML Element. The <img/> tag below is self-closing in that it does not 
wrap anything but instead directly inputs the provided image as an HTML Element.

<img src="appacademy.io/images/app-academy-logo.img" />

Notice that this image tag received additional information by declaring what 
is called an attribute. Attributes receive values in double quotes. The src 
attribute provides a url to the image tag for the browser to get and render
the proper image inside the HTML Element. Mastering the various tags and 
attributes is the first key to becoming proficient in HTML.

### Tags ###

The following are examples of popular tags in HTML and how they are used.

## Paragraphs and HEadings ##

<p>A paragraph tag is used to wrap a multi-line body of text</p>

<h1>A heading1 tag is used to denote the largest title on the page</h1>

The <h1> tag is used in site ranking algorithms by search engines such as Google. 
It is important to only have one <h1> element per page and to have it contain
a keyword summarizing the page content. 

<h2>Used for titles with a smaller font size than h1</h2>

The heading tags should be used in descending order with regards to their containing
font sizes. the smalles is a 

<h6>Heading six tag</h6>

The ordered list is usually used to display numbered list elements:

<ol>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Third</li>
</ol>

the definition list is not as common but used to hold defintion data and term
elements

<dl>
    <dt>Unordered List</dt>
    <dd>An HTML element made up of list elements in no particular order</dd>
    <dt>Ordered List</dt>
    <dd>An HTML element made up of list elements in order</dd>
    <dt>Definiton List</dt>
    <dd>An HTML element with definition term and definition data elements</dd>
</dl>

### Links ###

What is commonly referred to around the internet as a "link" is a clickable element that directs the browser to another
page or area on the page. This is not to be confused with a link tag, which will be discussed in future sections.

To create a link using an html element we use what is called an anchor tag:

<a href="http://appacademy.io">App Academy</a>

Notice that the URL for which this clickable anchor tag element will make a GET request to is provided through an href
attribute. The text within the anchor tag element is the what appears as clickable on the page.

In the following code we create two anchor tags. One is self-closing with a name attribute and the other contains text
that has an href attribute with the same name value preceded by a #. This is how we create in-page links. Clicking the
'Back to top' link wherever it is placed on the page will now take the user to the location of the named anchor tag.

<a name="top-of-page" />
<!-- Imagine all of your other content in between. By the way, this is how we denote comments in HTML. -->
<a href="#top-of-page">Back to top</a>

The use of the # in the beginning of the url tells the browser to find an element on the page with the given name
attribute instead of making a new GET request.

### Images ###

We create image elements in HTML using a self-closing image tag with the src attribute referring to the path to the
image data.

`<img src="http://appacademy.io/images/app-academy-logo.img" alt="app-academy-logo" />`

The alt attribute provides alternate text for the image which is used in image search rankings, speech-accessibility,
and displayed when a user hovers over the image.
