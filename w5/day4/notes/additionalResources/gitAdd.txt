USING GIT ADD

Use git add <files> or git add -A instead of git add . or git add -u

THE BACKGROUND

When you run git add . you're telling git, "take everything that's new or has
changed in my current directory and add it to the staging area". We discourage
this, because we usually are only working on a few files at a time and it is easy
to accidentally include files that have sensitive information (such as API
Keys, etc.).

When you run git add -A you are telling git, "take my all the changes from my entire
project up to my top level directory (where the .git directory resides) and all
those to my staging area". We also discourage this, because we usually are only 
working on a few files at a time and it si easy to accidentally changes that have
nothing to do with the current commit.
