HTML FORM ELEMENT

Forms in HTML allow for users/clients to interact with your application/website 
by inputting data. We create form elements using <form></form> tags and then 
fill the form with a selection of different types of control elements.

The following list references the HTML Forms Guide, excellent documentation 
written by the Mozilla Developer Network. Teaching and remembering every aspect 
of HTML would be both difficult and fairly unneccessary. Instead we should get 
used to being able to quickly search correct HTML syntax and practice reading 
online documentation.

The table contains links to references about the most popular HTML form elements, 
their most popular attributes and some of those attribute's most popular values. 
Read through the docs as well as the notes below and then use both to complete 
tonight's exercise.

Some notes on these popular HTML Elements:

    - Input Elements are by far the most common and special element of a form
    because they can take on completely different funcitonalites depending
    on their attribute type.

    - Labels can be written two ways, by wrapping the input element or by using
    the for attribute and applying a corresponding id attribute to the input.

    - Submitting forms makes a default post requirest with parameters made up by
    the provdied values for each name attribute

    - By giving each radio input element the same name attribute value, the 
    radio buttons will only allow the user to select one per radio of that name
    per form.

    - Option elements are defined inside a select element and the value attributes
    for each option display what will be inside the dropdown.
