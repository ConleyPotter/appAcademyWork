### What makes algorithm A *better* than algorithm B? ###

# Usually that means faster/speed 
# What are the factors? 
    # we can think about hardware
    # or the number of steps
    # language implementation
    # input size
        # finding a letter in a string, the string could be a word or a 
        # novel

# but what can be controlled by the algorithm?
    # a language lives in a space free from the hardware and language implementation
