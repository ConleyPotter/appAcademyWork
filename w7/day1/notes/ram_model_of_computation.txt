### What constitutes a step? ###

+ = 1 step
- = 1.2 steps
* = 1.3 steps
/ = 1.8 steps
<, > = 1 step
<=,>= = 2 steps
=== = 1 step
loop n do 

end = n/2 steps (maybe)

this is the value of a model of computation, becuase this step model depends
on hardware and language implementation

this adds too much complexity to our analysis

instead lets use a model of computation

  in the RAM model:
  - all the above operations, minus the loop, are 1 step
  the loop has n * # number of steps in each iteration

  - memory access function calls = 1 step
  - maps pretty well to the real world of computation
