# O(g) = {f
            f does not dominate
          g}
g = n**2
g = 2n + 1000000[1000000 does not dominate 2n]
g = 2**n
g = n**2 / n    [n does not dominate n**2]

O(2n**2) == O(n**2)
but the left side doesn't even make sense, it ignore asymptotic analysis
this can be described as simplicity

if an algorithm has two parts:
1.) O(n)
2.) O(n**3) 
then its big o notation is O(n**3) because 2.) dominates 1.)
