# At this point, you may be wondering to yourself: what in the world does
# programming paradigm even mean? You're in luck. You're not the only one.
# Programming paradigms are just ways to classify programming languages according
# to their style.

# There are a lot of different styles of programming, and a programming language
# isn't necessarily bound to one specific style. For now, let's talk about two
# opposite styles in Ruby, imperative and declarative.

### Imperative Programming ###

# THe original style of high-level languages, imperative programming just
# feeds step-by-step insturciton for the comptuer to execute.

def imperative_odds(array)
  idx = 0
  odds = []
  while (idx < array.length)
    if array[idx].odd?
      odds << array[idx]
    end
    i += 1
  end
  odds
end

### Declarative Programming ###

# In contrast, declarative programming describes what you want to achieve,
# without going into too much detail about how you're going to do it.

def declarative_odds(array)
  odds = array.select { |el| el.odd? }
end

# The given examples are functionally the same, but are fundamentally different
# in style. Keep in mind, although programming languages like Ruby allow for
# different styles, certain languages restrict themselves to the guidelines of
# a specific programming paradigm. In the next reading, you'll find SQL is an
# example of declarative programming.
