# We know how to format SQL code in a .sql file, but what if we mix SQL into our
# Ruby code? The answer is to use a heredoc to write multi-line strings with 
# ease:

query = <<-SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
SQL

db.execute(query)

# This replaces <<-SQL with the text on the next line, up to the closing SQL. 
# We could use any string for the start and end of a heredoc; SQL is just the 
# convention when we are embedding SQL code.

# A heredoc produces a string just like quotes does, and it will return into the 
# place where the opening statement is. For example, this works as well:

db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
WHERE
  posts.id = ?
SQL

# Notice the use of the ? interpolation mark; the Ruby variable post_id will be 
# inserted into the query at the ?.

# It is also possible to pass variables to a query using key-value pairs.

db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id: post_id)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
WHERE
  posts.id = :post_id
SQL

# In this case, the corresponding value is inserted in the query in place of the 
# symbol :post_id.

# What's the difference between using a ? versus a key-value pair? Values bound 
# to the ? are done so positionally. So the first argument passed to a heredoc 
# corresponds to the first ? in your SQL query code.

# On the other hand in key-value pairs the key acts as the placeholder for its 
# corresponding value variable. The order of key-value pair arguments doesn't 
# matter as a result.

# If you use a ? or key-value pair to pass in variables to a SQL query, SQLite3 
# will help protect against SQL injection attempts by escaping potentially 
# malicious code for you.
