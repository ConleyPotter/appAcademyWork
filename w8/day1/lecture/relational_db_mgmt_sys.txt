- This is what's known as the relational model
    - every row will have a unique primary key, so that no two students have the
      the same primary key
    - an RDBMS takes the queries and queries the database with that query
    - Ex: SQLite is a very light weight RDMBS, it's serverless and is great
    when we have concerns about space
        - the entire DB can be stored in a file
        - never used in a production web app, bc it doesn't have a server, doesn't
        handle mutliple requests coming in very well

- How do we get to the point we're at above, with a table and data and a server

### Data Definition Language & Data Manipulation Lang ###

- DDL: defines the structure of our tables
    - this is where we build the tables
    - CREATE table
    - DROP (inverse)

- DML: allows us to add, edit, or delete data in tables
    - SELECT: most common word in the DML
    - INSERT
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE

### SQLite Key Terms ###
.tables 
    - displays table names
.schemas
    - displays the schemas of your tables
