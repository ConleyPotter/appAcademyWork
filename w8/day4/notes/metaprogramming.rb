### Metaprogramming and Reflection ###

# Goals:

# - Learn how to use send
# - Learn how to use define_method
# - Learn how to use method_missing

### send and define_method ###

# One of the powers of Ruby is reflection (also called introspection): the 
# ability for a program to examine itself.

# For starters, we can ask an object what methods it will respond to:

obj = Object.new
obj.methods
 => [:nil?, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :<=>, :class, ...]

# Object#methods returns an array of symbols, each the name of a method that 
# can be sent to the object. This is helpful for debugging, but not super useful 
# in production code.

# More significantly, we can call a method by name:

[].send(:count) # => 0

# When is something like send useful? Why not just call the method the normal 
# way? Well, using send lets us write methods like this:

def do_three_times(object, method_name)
  3.times { object.send(method_name) }
end

class Dog
  def bark
    puts "Woof"
  end
end

dog = Dog.new
do_three_times(dog, :bark)

# We can even define new methods dynamically with define_method:

class Dog
  # defines a class method that will define more methods; this is
  # called a **macro**.

  def self.makes_sound(name)
    define_method(name) { puts "#{name}!" }
  end

  makes_sound(:woof)
  makes_sound(:bark)
  makes_sound(:grr)
end

dog = Dog.new
dog.woof
dog.bark
dog.grr

# A couple notes:

# - The code inside Dog class is executed at the time Ruby defines the Dog class. 
#   makes_sound is called at class definition time, not each time a new Dog 
#   object is created.
# - That makes sense, because the work of makes_sound sets up an instance method 
#   to be shared by all Dog objects. It's not instance-specific.
# - Inside the definition of the Dog class, makes_sound knows to call the class 
#   method because self == Dog here.
# - In the makes_sound macro, self == Dog because this is a Dog class method. 
#   define_method is implicitly called on Dog, adding a new method named name. 
#   The block is the code to run when the method is (later) called on an 
#   instance of Dog.

# We don't write macros every single day, but they are frequently quite useful.
# Some of the most famous macro methods are:

# attr_accessor: defines getter/setter methods given an instance variable name.
# belongs_to/has_many: defines a method to perform a SQL query to fetch 
# associated objects.

### method_missing ###

# When a method is called on an object, Ruby first looks for an existing method 
# with that name. If no such method exists, then it calls the 
# Object#method_missing method. It passes the method name (as a symbol) and any 
# arguments to #method_missing.

# The default version simply raises an exception about the missing method, but 
# you may override #method_missing for your own purposes:

class T
  def method_missing(*args)
    p args
  end
end

T.new.adfasdfa(:a, :b, :c) # => [:adfasdfa, :a, :b, :c]

# Here's a simple example:

class Cat
  def say(anything)
    puts anything
  end

  def method_missing(method_name)
    method_name = method_name.to_s
    if method_name.start_with?("say_")
      text = method_name[("say_".length)..-1]

      say(text)
    else
      # do the usual thing when a method is missing (i.e., raise an
      # error)
      super
    end
  end
end

earl = Cat.new
earl.say_hello # puts "hello"
earl.say_goodbye # puts "goodbye"

# Using method_missing, we are able to "define" an infinite number of methods; 
# we allow the user to call any method prefixed say_ on a Cat. This is very 
# powerful; it isn't possible to do this using define_method itself.

# However, overriding method_missing can result in difficult to understand/debug 
# to code, and should not be your first resort when attempting metaprogramming. 
# Only if you want this infinite expressability should you use method_missing; 
# prefer a macro if the user just wants to define a small set of methods.

### An advanced Example: Dynamic Finders ###

# What if we overrode #method_missing in ActiveRecord::Base to work for 
# find_by_* methods, so we could do the following:

User.find_by_first_name_and_last_name("Ned", "Ruggeri")
User.find_by_username_and_state("ruggeri", "California")

# We could do this by parsing the "missing" method name and combining the column 
# names (separated by ands) with the given arguments. It might look something 
# like this:

class ActiveRecord::Base
  def method_missing(method_name, *args)
    method_name = method_name.to_s
    if method_name.start_with?("find_by_")
      # attributes_string is, e.g., "first_name_and_last_name"
      attributes_string = method_name[("find_by_".length)..-1]

      # attribute_names is, e.g., ["first_name", "last_name"]
      attribute_names = attributes_string.split("_and_")

      unless attribute_names.length == args.length
        raise "unexpected # of arguments"
      end

      search_conditions = {}
      attribute_names.length.times do |i|
        search_conditions[attribute_names[i]] = args[i]
      end

      # Imagine search takes a hash of search conditions and finds
      # objects with the given properties.
      self.search(search_conditions)
    else
      # complain about the missing method
      super
    end
  end
end

# NB: Dynamic finders were actually a feature of Rails until just recently. 
# Rails 4.2 deprecated (supported, but didn't recommend) dynamic finders, and as 
# of Rails 5, they are no longer supported. Although, they are quite handy, 
# they tend to lead to overly verbose code and are not very performant. For 
# these reasons we also recommend against using them. Check out this blog post 
# if you'd like to learn more.

### Type Introspection ###

# So far we focused on finding, defining, and calling methods at runtime. We can 
# also find class information:

"who am i".class # => String
"who am i".is_a?(String) # => true

# I commonly use Object#class when debugging or using pry to see what kind of 
# thing I'm dealing with, so that I can then know what class to look up the 
# documentation for.

# Here we can see that even classes are objects in Ruby:

Object.is_a?(Object) # => true

# such meta, wow
# Deep. Let's dig deeper:

Object.class # => Class

# Okay, all classes are instances of a Class class.

Class.superclass # => Module
Class.superclass.superclass # => Object

# Classes are types of Modules (not important), which are Objects. In Ruby 
# everything is an Object, even Classes!

# To summarize: Object is of type Class, which is a subclass of Object itself. 
# Whoa!

### Methods with Varying Argument Types ##

# Say we have written a method perform_get that fetches a resource over the 
# internet. As a convenience to the user, we'd like perform_get to take either 
# a String, which is the literal URL to fetch, or a hash, with the URL broken 
# into parts

perform_get("http://www.google.com/+")
perform_get(
  :scheme => :http,
  :host => "www.google.com",
  :path => "/+"
)

# In the case where we give perform_get a hash, it's going to need to do some 
# extra work to construct the URL to get. How might this work? Perhaps like so:

def perform_get(url)
  if url.is_a?(Hash)
    # url is actually a hash of url options, call another method
    # to turn it into a string representation.
    url = make_url(url)
  end

  # ...
end

# This is a quite common trick used by library writers to make their methods 
# much more flexible. You may not write a method like this often, but as you 
# grow more experienced, this kind of trick will come in handy from time to time.
