### Building a JSON API ###

# A browser issues HTTP requests to a web server. For instance, a browser issues 
# a GET request when you click a link (<a> tag), or a POST may be issued when 
# you submit an HTML form. A typical Rails application will reply with HTML 
# that will then be displayed by the browser.

# Browsers aren't the only program that can make HTTP requests. When a 
# non-browser client makes an API request, the requestor probably prefers a 
# raw representation of the data rather than an HTML document that includes a 
# lot of extraneous formatting information and is difficult to parse. JSON is 
# typically a better format for non-browser clients.

# Consumers of a web API can be third-party developers, but you can also consume 
# your own API. Your web app may contain JavaScript code that the user's browser 
# runs; this JS code may make background requests to the API to dynamically 
# update content. We'll wait until we learn JavaScript to talk about this, but 
# the point is that even if you don't support third-party partners, you may find 
# yourself using your own API.

# APIs are big, friend.

### JSON & Rails ###

# The key to building a Rails API is to get your controllers to convert model 
# objects into JSON, and then return the JSON. This requires support at two 
# layers: the model layer (convert a model to JSON) and the controller layer 
# (return the JSON to the user).

## Models & to_json ###

# Let's take a look at the model layer:

$ rails console
> Wizard.first
=> #<Wizard id: 1, fname: "Harry", lname: "Potter", house_id: 1,
school_id: 1, created_at: "2013-06-04 00:31:04",
updated_at: "2013-06-04 00:31:04">

> Wizard.first.to_json
=> "{\"created_at\":\"2013-06-04T00:31:04Z\",\"fname\":\"Harry\",
\"house_id\":1,\"id\":1,\"lname\":\"Potter\",
\"school_id\":1,\"updated_at\":\"2013-06-04T00:31:04Z\"}"

# Note that the to_json method actually produces a JSON string.

## Controllers & render json:

# Controllers, too, support responding to a request with JSON.

# Remember that all controller actions must end in some response back to the 
# requestor. That response in Rails is built by calling either render (places 
# something in the response body) or redirect_to (sends a response that asks 
# the requestor to make a whole new request to a different URL).

# Usually, when we call render, we'll specify an HTML template. An HTML template 
# consists of HTML code, with annotations where data can be inserted. We'll 
# learn more about them soon.

# Today we just want to send a JSON representation of a certain object. Easy 
# enough:

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    users = User.all
    render json: users
  end

  def show
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    render json: user
  end
end

# A few things to note:

# - The controller specifies that it is rendering JSON with render json:.
# - Under the hood, the object you pass will automatically have to_json called 
#   on it, so there is no need to explicitly call it on the object.
# - to_json works on both collections (arrays) and individual objects.

# And now you know everything about JSON
