# You are not limited to the seven routes that RESTful routing creates by 
# default. If you like, you may add additional routes that apply to the 
# collection or individual members of the collection.

### Adding Member Routes ###

# To add a member route, just add a member block into the resource block:

resources :photos do
  member do
    get 'preview'
  end
end

# A GET request for /photos/1/preview will be routed to the preview action of 
# PhotosController. It will also create a preview_photo_url helper.

# Within the block of member routes, each route name specifies the HTTP verb 
# that it will recognize. You can use get, post, put, or delete here.

### Adding Collectino Routes ###

# To add a route to the collection:

resources :photos do
  collection do
    get 'search'
  end
end

# This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as /photos/search with GET, 
# and route to the search action of PhotosController. It will also create a 
# search_photos_url helper.

### A Note of Caution ###

# Don't go crazy and start adding lots of new, non-default routes. That is 
# almost certainly wrong.

# Try to do things the RESTful way. In particular, each time you add a new, 
# custom controller action (a new "verb"), think about whether you could instead 
# introduce a new resource using the conventional verbs.

# REST turns object-oriented programming on its head a bit. Instead of adding 
# new methods so that our objects can do more and more things, we keep adding 
# new resources that all do the same things.

# Later we'll talk about why this is a desirable approach. For now, feel a sense 
# of foreboding each time you add a new, non-RESTful route. Ask your TA about 
# each.
